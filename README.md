# SimpleFR
This is a very simple face recognition code based on [face recognition api](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition). The face recognition is built using [dlib's](https://github.com/davisking/dlib) state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

Face detector
- HOG + Linear SVM (prefered for fast inference speed on resource constrained device)
- CNNs

## Setup
Create conda environment
```bash
conda create --name ws python=3.11 -y
conda activate ws
```

Install dlib on macos and Ubuntu
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davisking/dlib.git
cd dlib
sudo apt  install cmake
mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; cmake --build .
cd ..
python3 setup.py install
cd ../
```

Install the face recognition api
```bash
pip install face-recognition==1.3.0
pip install opencv-python==4.10.0.84
```
